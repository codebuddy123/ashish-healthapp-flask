You being a python developer please do this task.
Develop a flask based application for Ashish Hospitals
where you have to use this following stack
Front-End: Beautiful UI with reponsive pages developed in HTML,CSS,JS,and Tailwind.
Back-end: Python and Flask
Database: For patients appointment, use MongoDB as your Database. Patient form should contain Patient Name, Phonenumber, Email and City.

Start the db service

Prerequisites
=================
1. Python 3.x installed
2. MongoDB installed and running locally or use MongoDB Atlas for cloud database.
3. pip package manager installed

Creating a User in MongoDB with necessary privileges
======================================================
mongosh
use admin
create a user in the db with necessary privileges

db.createUser({
  user: "ashish",
  pwd: "Test123",
  roles: [ { role: "root", db: "admin" } ]
})
exit

Running the application Locally
--------------------------------
1. Create and activate virtual env.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Browse http://localhost:8000 to see the app.

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the flask app.

python app.py

Browse http://localhost:8000 to see the app.
After you book the appointment, you can check the data in mongodb shell.

4. Check data in MongoDB shell
mongosh -u ashish -p Test123 --authenticationDatabase admin
use ashish_hospital;
show collections;

db.appointments.find()
db.appointments.find().pretty()

Containerizing the application
================================

1) Set the variables for the app in .env file in the project root folder.
if file doesn't exist, create one with following content.

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ashish:Test123@ashish-mongo:27017/ashish_hospital?authSource=admin
DATABASE_NAME=ashish_hospital

Note: If you are running the application in the local system then use localhost
or if you are using the application in the EC2 user, replace ashish-mongo with the ip address of mongoserver.
Here is the explanation of the above URL.

* mongodb:// is the protocol
* ashish: MongoDB username (set in the MongoDB container)
* Test123: MongoDB password (set in the MongoDB container)
* ashish-mongo: The name of the MongoDB container (Docker lets containers on the same network talk to each other by name)
* 27017: Default MongoDB port
* ashish_hospital: The database name

2)
docker network create ashish-net. [bridge by default]
This ensures that containers can communicate using their name.


3) Launch Mongo container
docker run -d \
  --name ashish-mongo \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  --network ashish-net \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=ashish_hospital \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=ashish \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=Test123 \
  mongo:7
  
  
4) Build the image for the flask application
# Build for current architecture (automatic)
docker build -t ashish-hospital-app .


# Or explicitly specify ARM64
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t ashish-hospital-app .

# For multi-platform build (both AMD64 and ARM64)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t ashish-hospital-app .

Run any of the above commands based on your requirement.

5) Run the flask app container

docker run -p 8000:8000 --network ashish-net --env-file .env ashish-hospital-app

6) To check the data, go inside the container
docker exec -it ashish-mongo bash

7) Login to the database with credentials on that particular db.
mongosh -u ashish -p Test123 --authenticationDatabase admin ashish_hospital

8) Now check your data which is inserted through appointment form in UI.

db.appointments.find().pretty()


Running the application using Docker Compose
--------------------------------------------
1) Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed.
2) Create a .env file in the root folder with the following content.
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ashish:Test123@ashish-mongo:27017/ashish_hospital?authSource=admin
DATABASE_NAME=ashish_hospital

3) Run the following command to start the services.
docker-compose up -d --build
4) The Flask app will be accessible at http://localhost:8000
5) To stop the services, run:
docker-compose down

Already docker-compose file is created in the root folder.

Deploying it on AWS EC2 server and using DocumentDB as our database service
============================================================================

Prerequisite: Create an ubuntu instance with t2.medium on 24.04 for running flask app.
Check if python is installed.

a) Clone the code
b) Go into the project folder

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py


Now let us use DocumentDB service to connect
to our Application.

DocumentDB steps
=================

1) Create a cluster with 1 replica, username 'ashish', password "Test1234" (min 8char) and make sure SG has 27017 open.

2) You get following steps in the Connectivity and Security tab.

a) Download the Amazon DocumentDB Certificate Authority (CA) certificate required to authenticate to your instance
wget https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/global/global-bundle.pem

b) Connect to this instance with the mongo shell
mongosh health-app.c1ku20ei673y.ap-south-2.docdb.amazonaws.com:27017 --tls --tlsCAFile global-bundle.pem --retryWrites=false --username ashish --password <insertYourPassword>

c) Connect to this instance with an application
mongodb://ashish:<insertYourPassword>@health-app.c1ku20ei673y.ap-south-2.docdb.amazonaws.com:27017/?tls=true&tlsCAFile=global-bundle.pem&retryWrites=false [later we will use in our app]

Note: Your endpoint might be different.
Check the step b and see if u are connected to mongoshell. You need to install mongoshell or mongoclient based on OS.
Google this step.[optional step but will ensure if your ec2 can connect to mongodb]
Reference: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/


3) Now make ur .env file which looks like
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ashish:MySecretPass@health-app.c1ku20ei673y.ap-south-2.docdb.amazonaws.com:27017/ashish_hospital?tls=true&tlsCAFile=/home/ubuntu/global-bundle.pem&retryWrites=false
DATABASE_NAME=ashish_hospital

In the above URL in .env file,

Replace ashish with your username.
Replace MySecret pass with your password. [Test1234] in my demo.
CAFile=/path/to/downloaded.pem.   /home/ubuntu/global-bundle.pem in my demo.

4) Now after inserting the data from UI
connect to the shell using 
mongosh health-app.c1ku20ei673y.ap-south-2.docdb.amazonaws.com:27017 --tls --tlsCAFile global-bundle.pem --retryWrites=false --username ashish --password <insertYourPassword>

5) Now run mongo commands in mongoshell
use ashish_hospitals;
show dbs;
show collections;
db.appointments.find();
